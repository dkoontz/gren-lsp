# Epic 1 Story 1: Tree-sitter AST Baseline

## 📋 User Story
**As a** LSP developer  
**I want** comprehensive tree-sitter AST documentation for all Gren language constructs  
**So that** I can implement accurate parsing and symbol extraction

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Reference Gren file created with all language constructs (COMPLETED)
- [x] AST baseline generated using `tree-sitter parse` command (COMPLETED)
- [x] AST documentation created in `docs/tree-sitter-ast/README.md` (COMPLETED)
- [x] Query patterns documented for functions, imports, types (COMPLETED)
- [x] Node types and field mappings documented (COMPLETED)

## 🧪 Integration Test Requirements

### Test: AST Generation Accuracy
- Parse reference file and verify all language constructs captured
- Compare generated AST against expected node structures
- Verify no parsing errors or missing nodes

### Test: Query Pattern Validation
- Test tree-sitter queries extract correct symbols
- Verify query patterns work with complex nested structures
- Test query performance with large files

### Test: Documentation Completeness
- Verify all node types documented with examples
- Test that documentation enables symbol extraction implementation
- Validate query pattern examples work correctly

## ✅ Definition of Done
- Complete AST structure captured and documented
- Query patterns tested and verified for accuracy
- Documentation enables implementation of symbol extraction
- No parsing errors in reference file
- All Gren language constructs represented in AST

## 📁 Related Files
- `docs/tree-sitter-ast/TreeSitterReference.gren` (COMPLETED)
- `docs/tree-sitter-ast/baseline.ast` (TO BE GENERATED)
- `docs/tree-sitter-ast/README.md` (TO BE CREATED)

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Tree-sitter CLI tool installed
- Tree-sitter Gren grammar available
- Reference Gren file with comprehensive language constructs

## 📊 Status
**Completed** - All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive AST documentation created
