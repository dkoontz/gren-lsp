# Story 3.3: Implement Rename Refactoring

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want to** safely rename symbols across the entire workspace,
**so that** I can refactor my code with confidence that all references are updated correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Handle textDocument/rename requests
- [x] Find all references to the symbol
- [x] Validate new name is valid Gren identifier
- [x] Generate workspace edit for all occurrences
- [x] Handle module-qualified names correctly
- [x] Preview changes before applying

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Implement LSP rename request handler** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update `rename` method in `gren-lsp-protocol/src/handlers.rs` to handle RenameParams
  - [x] Extract symbol at cursor position using existing `find_symbol_at_position` method
  - [x] Validate that symbol exists and is renameable (not a keyword or built-in)
- [x] **Implement symbol name validation** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `is_valid_gren_identifier` function to check identifier rules
  - [x] Ensure new name doesn't conflict with Gren keywords

  - [x] Handle both qualified (`Module.symbol`) and unqualified (`symbol`) references  
  - [x] Use existing import-aware search from `find_unqualified_symbol` method
  - [x] Leverage symbol index for efficient cross-file searches
- [x] **Generate workspace edit for atomic rename** (AC: 4, 6)
  - [x] Create `WorkspaceEdit` with `TextEdit` entries for each occurrence
  - [x] Ensure atomicity - all changes succeed or none are applied
  - [x] Handle edge cases like shadowing (prefer local definitions over imports)
  - [x] Test with module-qualified renames to preserve qualification
- [x] **Add unit tests for rename functionality** (AC: All)
  - [x] Test local symbol renaming within single file
  - [x] Test cross-file renaming with imports
  - [x] Test module-qualified symbol renaming  
  - [x] Test error cases (invalid names, non-existent symbols)
  - [x] Test edge cases (shadowing, name conflicts)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 was found in Draft status, but the user indicated Epic 1 & 2 have been completed through manual testing. The existing project structure is fully established with proper workspace organization, LSP protocol handlers, and symbol indexing infrastructure already in place.

### Data Models
**Symbol Model**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#symbol-model]
- Symbol references are stored as `Array<Location>` 
- Symbols have `visibility` field (Public, private, module-internal) for scope validation
- Symbol locations include precise file/line/column data for accurate text replacement
- Symbol names include `kind` field to distinguish functions, types, constructors, etc.

**Workspace Model**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#workspace-model]
- Maintains `symbol_index: SymbolIndex` for global symbol database with cross-file operations
- Stores `source_files: HashMap<PathBuf, SourceFile>` for accessing document content
- Symbol index uses SQLite backend for efficient reference lookups

### API Specifications
**LSP Protocol Methods**: [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#language-server-protocol-specification]
- `textDocument/rename` - Main rename request handler returning WorkspaceEdit
- Must handle RenameParams with textDocument URI, position, and newName
- Return WorkspaceEdit with documentChanges containing TextEdit arrays per file

**Symbol Index Interface**: [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#symbol-index]
- `find_symbol(name: &str) -> Vec<Symbol>` - Symbol search capability already implemented
- `get_references(symbol: Symbol) -> Vec<Location>` - Reference finding interface
- SQLite backend provides efficient cross-file symbol lookups

### Component Specifications
**LSP Protocol Handler**: [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#lsp-protocol-handler]
- Current `rename` method in `handlers.rs` is TODO stub (line 433)
- Existing infrastructure for symbol finding via `find_symbol_at_position` method
- Import-aware symbol resolution through `find_qualified_symbol` and `find_unqualified_symbol`

**Analysis Engine Integration**: [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#analysis-engine]
- Workspace maintains document content for text edit generation
- Existing symbol indexing provides foundation for reference finding
- Tree-sitter parsing ensures accurate identifier boundary detection

### File Locations
**Protocol Handlers**: `/gren-lsp-protocol/src/handlers.rs` - Main rename implementation location
**Core Analysis**: `/gren-lsp-core/src/symbol.rs` - Symbol model and indexing logic  
**Testing**: `/gren-lsp-protocol/tests/` - Integration tests for LSP rename functionality
**Unit Tests**: `/gren-lsp-protocol/src/handlers.rs` - `#[cfg(test)]` modules alongside implementation

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Unit tests using `cargo test` with mockall for workspace mocking
- Integration tests in `/tests/` directories for cross-file rename scenarios
- Test frameworks: `cargo test`, `criterion`, `mockall` already configured in workspace

**Specific Test Cases Required**:
- Single-file symbol renaming (local functions, types, variables)
- Cross-file renaming with explicit imports (`import Module exposing (symbol)`)
- Module-qualified renaming (`Module.symbol` -> `Module.newName`)
- Error cases: invalid identifiers, keywords, non-existent symbols
- Edge cases: symbol shadowing, name conflicts

### Technical Constraints

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Tree-sitter AST Requirement**: [Source: docs/architecture/tree-sitter-ast-structure.md]
- **MANDATORY**: All symbol context determination MUST use tree-sitter AST analysis
- **NEVER**: Use text-based parsing (regex, string matching) for symbol location or context
- **Tree-sitter Queries**: Use proper node selection: `(value_declaration)`, `(type_declaration)`, `(value_qid)`, etc.
- **Context Detection**: Use AST-based filtering for comments, imports, and module declarations
- **Reference**: See comprehensive AST structure guide and examples in tree-sitter architecture document

**Gren Language Characteristics**: [Source: docs/architecture/gren-specific-lsp-considerations.md]
- **No polymorphic overloading**: Function names are unique within scope, enabling precise symbol resolution
- **Deterministic imports**: Explicit import statements with no ambiguity - exact symbol resolution
- **Pure functional**: No side effects enable safe refactoring operations
- **Array-first data model**: Use arrays for storing references for better performance

**Error Handling Strategy**: [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#graceful-degradation]
- **Critical requirement**: Never provide incorrect rename results - better to fail than rename wrong symbol
- Implement graceful degradation for partial analysis failures
- Use structured error reporting with precise diagnostic information

### Performance Considerations
**Symbol Index Optimization**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#workspace-model]
- SQLite database provides efficient symbol lookups across large codebases
- LRU caching in workspace for frequently accessed documents
- Incremental parsing minimizes reanalysis overhead during rename operations

## Testing
### Test File Locations:
- Unit tests: `gren-lsp-protocol/src/handlers.rs` - `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- Integration tests: `gren-lsp-protocol/tests/rename_tests.rs`
- Mock workspace setup: Use `tempfile` and `mockall` crates

### Testing Standards:
- Use `cargo test` for unit test execution
- Mock workspace using `mockall` for isolated testing
- Use `tempfile` for temporary test workspaces with actual files
- Follow Rust testing conventions with descriptive test names

### Specific Testing Requirements:
- Test rename validation (valid Gren identifiers only)
- Test cross-file reference finding accuracy
- Test WorkspaceEdit generation with correct text ranges
- Test atomicity of rename operations (all-or-nothing)
- Test module-qualified vs unqualified symbol handling
- Test error handling for edge cases and invalid inputs

## Project Structure Notes
Current LSP handler implementation is well-structured with existing symbol finding capabilities. The `rename` method currently returns `Ok(None)` as a TODO stub, providing a clear integration point for the new functionality. Existing methods like `find_symbol_at_position`, `find_qualified_symbol`, and symbol index operations provide the foundation needed for comprehensive rename implementation.
