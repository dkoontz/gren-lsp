- [ ] Test all Epic 2 features: symbol indexing, code completion, hover information, go-to-definition
- [ ] Test all Epic 3 features: find references, document symbols, performance optimization
- [ ] Test all Epic 4 features: code actions, workspace symbols, safe symbol rename
- [ ] Test all Epic 5 features: advanced refactoring (module rename if implemented)
- [ ] Validate LSP protocol compliance for all implemented features
- [ ] Document integration test results with detailed pass/fail analysis
- [ ] Identify any features that work in server but fail through extension

## 🧪 Integration Test Requirements
