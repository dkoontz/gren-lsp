# Error Handling Strategy

## Graceful Degradation
- **Partial Analysis:** Provide available information even when full analysis fails
- **Error Recovery:** Continue operation despite individual file parsing failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Basic syntax highlighting when semantic analysis unavailable

## Diagnostic Reporting
- **Structured Errors:** Rich diagnostic information with precise location data
- **Error Categories:** Distinguish between syntax errors, type errors, and LSP internal errors
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Summary diagnostics with detailed information on request

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing a high-performance, feature-rich Language Server Protocol implementation for the Gren programming language, addressing all requirements outlined in the PRD while maintaining focus on developer experience and system performance.
