# Performance Considerations

## Startup Time Optimization
- **Symbol Index Persistence:** Pre-built symbol database reduces initial workspace analysis time
- **Lazy Loading:** Core LSP features available immediately, advanced analysis loaded incrementally
- **Parallel Initialization:** File parsing and indexing performed concurrently during startup

## Memory Management
- **Incremental Analysis:** Only reanalyze changed files and their dependents
- **LRU Caching:** Bounded memory usage for AST and analysis results
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Compact representations for symbols and type information

## Real-time Responsiveness
- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking request handling for editor responsiveness
- **Request Prioritization:** Interactive operations (completion, hover) prioritized over background analysis
- **Debounced Updates:** Batch rapid file changes to prevent analysis thrashing
