# Summary

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for the Gren LSP server while maintaining the correctness and reliability principles important to the Gren language ecosystem. The integration of lsp-types and lsp-textdocument significantly reduces implementation complexity and potential bugs, allowing the team to focus on Gren-specific language intelligence features.
