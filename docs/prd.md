  Project Overview

  The Gren LSP is a Language Server Protocol implementation for the Gren programming
  language - a functional language forked from Elm with plans for backend development
  support. Currently, Gren has minimal editor support and no dedicated LSP implementation.

  Core LSP Features Required

  Essential Language Features

  - Syntax highlighting - Support for Gren's functional syntax including functions, types,
   modules, and operators
  - Error diagnostics - Integration with Gren compiler to show type errors, syntax errors,
   and warnings
  - Code completion - Autocomplete for functions, types, module imports, and built-in
  constructs
  - Go-to definition - Navigate to function definitions, type declarations, and module
  sources
  - Hover information - Display type signatures and documentation on hover
  - Symbol search - Find symbols across the workspace

  Advanced Features

  - Code formatting - Integration with Gren's planned formatter
  - Refactoring support - Rename symbols, extract functions
  - Type checking - Real-time type validation using Gren's type system
  - Import management - Auto-import suggestions and cleanup

  Target Editor Support

  - Primary: VS Code (largest developer base)
  - Secondary: Helix (has existing basic Gren support), Vim/Neovim, Emacs
  - Future: JetBrains IDEs, Sublime Text

  Technical Integration Requirements

  - Compiler integration - Interface with Gren compiler for AST parsing and type checking
  - Module system - Support Gren's module imports and exports
  - Task/concurrent support - Understanding of Gren's concurrency model
  - Error handling - Support for Maybe/Result types and no-exception model

  User Personas

  - Functional programming newcomers transitioning from JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Elm developers exploring Gren as an alternative
  - Backend developers interested in Gren's planned server-side capabilities
  - Type safety advocates seeking reliable tooling support

  Performance Constraints

  - Fast startup time for responsive editing experience
  - Incremental compilation support for large codebases
  - Memory-efficient symbol indexing
  - Real-time error checking without blocking the editor

  The current gap is significant - Gren lacks comprehensive tooling, making this LSP
  implementation crucial for developer adoption and productivity.
