# Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Deliverables**:
- Tree-sitter baseline AST capture and documentation (prerequisite)
- Basic LSP server lifecycle (initialize, shutdown, exit)
- Document synchronization (didOpen, didChange, didClose)
- Basic diagnostics from compiler output
- Tree-sitter integration for parsing

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete AST baseline captured and documented in `docs/tree-sitter-ast/`
- Server starts and shuts down correctly
- Documents sync properly with no data loss
- No crashes during normal operation

## Phase 2: Core Language Features
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Deliverables**:
- Code completion for modules and local symbols
- Hover information with type signatures
- Go-to-definition for local and cross-module symbols
- Enhanced diagnostics with type errors

**Success Criteria**:
- Completion works reliably for common patterns
- Hover shows accurate type information
- Go-to-definition navigates correctly 90% of the time
- Type errors displayed with helpful messages

## Phase 3: Advanced Navigation
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Deliverables**:
- Find all references functionality
- Document symbol outline
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced error recovery

**Success Criteria**:
- References found accurately across project
- Symbol outline provides useful navigation
- Performance meets stated requirements
- Handles large projects (100+ files) effectively

## Phase 4: Polish and Enhancement
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Deliverables**:
- Code actions for common fixes
- Workspace symbols search
- Rename functionality
- Comprehensive documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- Code actions provide useful suggestions
- Workspace search finds symbols quickly
- Rename works safely across project
- Documentation supports user adoption

## Phase 5: VS Code Extension Integration
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Deliverables**:
- VS Code extension package
- Extension marketplace publication
- User installation guide
- Extension configuration options

**Success Criteria**:
- Extension installs and activates correctly
- LSP server starts automatically when opening Gren files
- All language features work seamlessly in VS Code
- User-friendly configuration interface
