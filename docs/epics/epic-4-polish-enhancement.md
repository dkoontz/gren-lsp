# Epic 4: Polish and Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## üéØ Epic Goal
Complete the professional-grade LSP feature set by adding Code Actions, Workspace Symbols, and Rename functionality to provide comprehensive development experience for Gren developers.

## üìù Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: Epic 1-3 completed (LSP foundation, core language intelligence, and advanced navigation)
- Technology stack: Rust, async-lsp, tree-sitter, SQLite symbol indexing, JSON-RPC communication
- Integration points: Symbol index database, LSP message handlers, tree-sitter query system, compiler integration, editor LSP clients

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added**: Code Actions (textDocument/codeAction), Workspace Symbols (workspace/symbol), and Rename (textDocument/rename) LSP features
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing symbol indexing infrastructure, LSP handler patterns, and compiler integration established in Epic 1-3
- **Success criteria**: Safe rename operations with 100% accuracy, helpful code actions for common fixes, fast workspace-wide symbol search

**Value Delivered**: Developers gain professional IDE experience with automated fixes, project-wide symbol search, and safe refactoring capabilities essential for maintaining large Gren codebases.

## üìã Stories

### Story 1: Code Actions for Common Fixes
**Priority**: High - Essential for professional development experience  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/codeAction to provide automated fixes for common compiler errors, import suggestions, and code quality improvements leveraging Gren's deterministic compiler diagnostics.

### Story 2: Workspace Symbol Search
**Priority**: High - Critical for large project navigation  
**Description**: Implement workspace/symbol to enable fast symbol search across entire project with fuzzy matching, enabling quick navigation to any function, type, or module in large codebases.

### Story 3: Safe Symbol Rename
**Priority**: Medium - Advanced refactoring capability  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/rename to provide safe symbol renaming across the entire project with 100% accuracy using Gren's deterministic import semantics and symbol resolution.

## üîß Compatibility Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Existing APIs remain unchanged**: LSP protocol extensions only, no changes to existing message handlers
- ‚úÖ **Database schema changes are backward compatible**: Extensions to existing SQLite symbol index for workspace search
- ‚úÖ **UI changes follow existing patterns**: Consistent with existing LSP response formats and editor integrations
- ‚úÖ **Performance impact is minimal**: Leverages existing symbol indexing and compiler integration infrastructure

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk**: Rename operations causing compilation errors due to missed references in complex Gren code patterns  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive symbol resolution validation, dry-run compilation before applying renames, rollback capability  
**Rollback Plan**: Features can be disabled via LSP capability negotiation, existing functionality remains unaffected, rename operations can be undone through editor undo functionality

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- ‚úÖ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met (100% accuracy for rename, helpful code actions, fast workspace search)
- ‚úÖ Existing functionality verified through comprehensive regression testing
- ‚úÖ Integration with symbol indexing, compiler diagnostics, and LSP handlers working correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated for new LSP capabilities and user-facing features
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing Epic 1-3 features
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met for large projects (100+ files)

---

## üîó Epic Dependencies & Integration

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Epic 1 completed (LSP foundation, document management, tree-sitter baseline)
- ‚úÖ Epic 2 completed (symbol indexing, completion, hover, go-to-definition)
- ‚úÖ Epic 3 completed (find references, document symbols, performance optimization)
- ‚úÖ SQLite symbol index operational with cross-project symbol resolution
- ‚úÖ Compiler integration for diagnostics and type information established

### Architecture Alignment
- **Symbol Index Extensions**: Workspace-wide symbol indexing, reference tracking for safe rename
- **Compiler Integration Extensions**: Code action suggestions from compiler diagnostics, validation for rename operations
- **LSP Handler Extensions**: textDocument/codeAction, workspace/symbol, textDocument/rename handlers
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient workspace symbol search with caching and incremental updates

## ‚úÖ Epic Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Code Actions provide actionable fixes for 80% of common compiler errors
- Workspace Symbol search returns relevant results in sub-second response times
- Rename operations maintain 100% compilation success rate with zero false references
- All features work correctly across modules and complex Gren language patterns

### Performance Success
- Code Actions: < 100ms response time for 95% of requests
- Workspace Symbol search: < 300ms response time for 95% of queries in 100+ file projects
- Rename operations: < 2 seconds for 95% of symbol renames in typical projects
- Memory usage remains bounded during intensive workspace operations

### Quality Success
- 100% test coverage for new code action, workspace symbol, and rename handlers
- Zero false positives in rename reference resolution (leveraging Gren's deterministic semantics)
- Code actions provide contextually appropriate suggestions based on cursor position and compiler diagnostics
- Graceful degradation when compiler information is unavailable

### User Experience Success
- Code actions integrate seamlessly with editor quick-fix workflows
- Workspace symbol search supports fuzzy matching and provides relevant results
- Rename operations provide clear preview of changes before application
- Error messages for failed operations are clear and actionable
