## Epic Success Criteria

### Epic 1 Success Criteria
- LSP server starts and communicates with editors correctly
- Documents open, edit, and close without data loss
- Compiler diagnostics appear accurately in editor
- No crashes during normal document editing workflow
- 100% test coverage for implemented LSP message handlers

### Epic 2 Success Criteria
- Completion works reliably for common Gren patterns in all major contexts
- **Hover shows accurate type information for 100% of symbols**
- Go-to-definition navigates correctly with 100% precision (no false positives)
- All language features handle Gren's deterministic semantics correctly

### Epic 3 Success Criteria
- Find References returns 100% accurate results with zero false positives
- Document Symbols provides complete hierarchical navigation for all Gren constructs
- Find References: < 200ms response time for 95% of requests
- Document Symbols: < 100ms response time for 95% of requests
- Handles projects with 100+ files effectively

## Implementation Dependencies

### Epic 1 Prerequisites
- Tree-sitter Gren grammar (external)
- Gren compiler binary available on system
- Rust toolchain 1.70+

### Epic 2 Prerequisites  
- Epic 1 completed (LSP foundation, document management)
- Symbol indexing infrastructure established
- Integration test framework operational

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development
All stories include comprehensive integration test requirements:
- Fresh server process spawning for each test
- Stdio communication with 1000ms timeouts
- JSON-RPC message validation
- Performance and accuracy verification

### Quality Standards
- 100% test coverage for all LSP message handlers
- Zero false positives in language feature results
- Response time targets met for all features
- Graceful error handling and recovery
