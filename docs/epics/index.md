# Gren LSP Implementation Epics

## Overview

This directory contains the epic and user story breakdown for the Gren LSP server implementation. Each epic represents a major phase of development with clear business value, broken down into implementable user stories.

## Epic Roadmap

### üéØ **Epic 1: Foundation & Testing** 
**Status**: Completed  
**Value**: Establish reliable LSP communication and document management foundation

| Story | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Story 1](stories/epic-1-story-1-treesitter-baseline.md) | Tree-sitter AST Baseline | Completed |
| [Story 2](stories/epic-1-story-2-lsp-service.md) | Core LSP Service Foundation with Tests | Completed |
| [Story 3](stories/epic-1-story-3-document-lifecycle.md) | Document Lifecycle Management | Completed |
| [Story 4](stories/epic-1-story-4-compiler-integration.md) | Basic Compiler Integration & Diagnostics | Completed |

### üß† **Epic 2: Core Language Intelligence**
**Status**: Completed  
**Value**: Essential developer assistance features (completion, hover, go-to-definition)

| Story | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Story 1](stories/epic-2-story-1-symbol-indexing.md) | Symbol Indexing & Cross-Module Resolution | Completed |
| [Story 2](stories/epic-2-story-2-code-completion.md) | Code Completion | Completed |
| [Story 3](stories/epic-2-story-3-hover-information.md) | Hover Information (100% accuracy) | Completed |
| [Story 4](stories/epic-2-story-4-goto-definition.md) | Go-to-Definition | Completed |

### üîç **Epic 3: Advanced Navigation & References**
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Value**: Complete essential LSP feature set with Find References and Document Symbols

| Story | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Story 1](stories/epic-3-story-1-find-references.md) | Find All References Implementation | Pending |
| [Story 2](stories/epic-3-story-2-document-symbols.md) | Document Symbol Hierarchy | Pending |
| [Story 3](stories/epic-3-story-3-performance-optimization.md) | Performance Optimization & Large Project Support | Pending |

## Epic Success Criteria

### Epic 1 Success Criteria
- LSP server starts and communicates with editors correctly
- Documents open, edit, and close without data loss
- Compiler diagnostics appear accurately in editor
- No crashes during normal document editing workflow
- 100% test coverage for implemented LSP message handlers

### Epic 2 Success Criteria
- Completion works reliably for common Gren patterns in all major contexts
- **Hover shows accurate type information for 100% of symbols**
- Go-to-definition navigates correctly with 100% precision (no false positives)
- All language features handle Gren's deterministic semantics correctly

### Epic 3 Success Criteria
- Find References returns 100% accurate results with zero false positives
- Document Symbols provides complete hierarchical navigation for all Gren constructs
- Find References: < 200ms response time for 95% of requests
- Document Symbols: < 100ms response time for 95% of requests
- Handles projects with 100+ files effectively

## Implementation Dependencies

### Epic 1 Prerequisites
- Tree-sitter Gren grammar (external)
- Gren compiler binary available on system
- Rust toolchain 1.70+

### Epic 2 Prerequisites  
- Epic 1 completed (LSP foundation, document management)
- Symbol indexing infrastructure established
- Integration test framework operational

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development
All stories include comprehensive integration test requirements:
- Fresh server process spawning for each test
- Stdio communication with 1000ms timeouts
- JSON-RPC message validation
- Performance and accuracy verification

### Quality Standards
- 100% test coverage for all LSP message handlers
- Zero false positives in language feature results
- Response time targets met for all features
- Graceful error handling and recovery
