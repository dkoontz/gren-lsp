## 🔍 QA Results

**Status: NEW TREE-SITTER QUERY ERROR - PARTIAL PROGRESS MADE**

### Critical Tree-Sitter Query Issue ❌ 
- **Issue**: Invalid field name "record" in tree-sitter query at line 22:11
- **Location**: tree_sitter_queries.rs:131 - field_access_expr query 
- **Impact**: Query compilation fails, preventing symbol indexing and reference extraction
- **Fix Required**: Change `record:` field to `target:` (correct field name for field_access_expr)

### Progress Assessment - Previous Issues Resolved ✅

#### ✅ SQL Table Issue FIXED
- **Previous Issue**: `references` was SQLite reserved keyword  
- **Resolution**: Successfully renamed to `symbol_references` (lines 212-227)
- **Verification**: Symbol index tests now pass, no SQL syntax errors

#### ✅ Test Quality Issues FIXED  
- **Previous Issue**: Tests allowed multiple outcomes with fallbacks
- **Resolution**: Tests now have specific expected assertions:
  - `include_declaration: true` → expects exactly 2 references
  - `include_declaration: false` → expects exactly 1 reference  
  - Non-existent symbols → expects exactly None (no fallbacks)
- **Compliance**: Now meets technical preference requirements

#### ✅ Reference Indexing Integration IMPLEMENTED
- **Previous Issue**: No database population logic
- **Resolution**: Full integration added:
  - `index_file()` calls `extract_references()` and `update_references_for_file()`
  - Database methods for reference CRUD operations implemented
  - Cross-module resolution infrastructure in place

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment - Updated

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Implement textDocument/references LSP handler with 100% accuracy | 🔄 BLOCKED | Handler complete but tree-sitter query prevents testing |
| ✅ Find all symbol references across multiple files in the workspace | 🔄 BLOCKED | Infrastructure complete, blocked by query compilation |
| ✅ Support both local and cross-module reference finding | 🔄 BLOCKED | Database schema and indexing ready, blocked by query error |
| ✅ Include/exclude declaration location based on includeDeclaration parameter | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | Proper filtering logic in find_references.rs:111-113 |
| ✅ Leverage Gren's deterministic semantics for zero false positives | 🔄 BLOCKED | Tree-sitter queries implemented but won't compile |
| ✅ Handle all symbol types: functions, types, variables, constants | 🔄 BLOCKED | Query coverage exists but compilation fails |

### Remaining Issue - Tree-Sitter Query Fix ⚠️

**Single Critical Fix Required:**
```rust
// Current (line 131 in tree_sitter_queries.rs):
(field_access_expr
  record: (value_expr) @ref.record      // ❌ WRONG FIELD NAME
  field: (lower_case_identifier) @ref.field)

// Required Fix:
(field_access_expr  
  target: (value_expr) @ref.target      // ✅ CORRECT FIELD NAME
  field: (lower_case_identifier) @ref.field)
```

### Final Assessment
- **87.5% Complete**: 7/8 major issues resolved from previous QA review
- **Single blocking issue**: Tree-sitter field name mismatch  
- **High confidence**: Once query fixed, implementation should be functional
- **Test quality**: Now meets all technical preference standards

**Recommendation**: The developer made excellent progress addressing all major architectural issues. Only one field name correction needed to unblock testing and validation.
