## üí° Code Action Examples

### Missing Import
```gren
-- Before (with error)
main = Html.text "Hello"

-- Code Action: "Import Html"
-- After
import Html
main = Html.text "Hello"
```

### Add Type Signature  
```gren
-- Before
add x y = x + y

-- Code Action: "Add type signature"
-- After
add : Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

### Remove Unused Import
```gren
-- Before
import Json.Decode
import Html

main = Html.text "Hello"

-- Code Action: "Remove unused import Json.Decode"
-- After  
import Html

main = Html.text "Hello"
```

This story addresses the productivity gap by providing automated fixes for common development scenarios, reducing manual typing and helping developers learn proper Gren patterns through suggested improvements.

## üîç QA Results - January 2025

**Status: STORY NOT READY FOR ACCEPTANCE ‚ùå**

### Critical Issues Found ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### ‚ùå Test Failure
- **Failed Test**: `test_no_actions_for_unknown_symbols` (src/code_actions_integration_tests.rs:306)
- **Issue**: Test expected empty actions for unknown symbols but implementation returns non-empty results
- **Impact**: Implementation behavior does not match expected specifications

#### ‚ùå Test Quality Violations  
Multiple tests violate the requirement for single expected results:

1. **`test_code_action_filtering_by_kind`** (line 262)
   - **Problem**: `assert!(actions.is_empty() || actions.len() < 2);` - Multiple possibilities allowed
   - **Required Fix**: Use exact assertion for expected result count

2. **`test_add_type_signature_code_action`** (lines 177-192)
   - **Problem**: No definitive assertion, just conditional printing
   - **Required Fix**: Add specific assertions for expected behavior

3. **`test_no_actions_for_unknown_symbols`** (line 306)
   - **Problem**: Assertion failed - expected empty but got actions
   - **Required Fix**: Either fix implementation or clarify expected behavior

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment ‚ùå

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |

### Test Execution Results ‚ùå
- **Test Results**: 7/8 tests passing (87.5% pass rate)
- **Critical Failure**: Unknown symbols test fails expectations
- **Test Quality Issues**: 3 tests have assertion problems
- **Performance**: Tests execute quickly (~0.03s)

### Implementation Quality Assessment üîÑ

#### Partial Implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Code Actions Engine**: Well-structured with proper error handling
- **Tree-sitter Integration**: Uses tree-sitter queries for parsing
- **LSP Protocol**: Follows LSP specification for CodeAction structure
- **Symbol Index Integration**: Properly integrated for import suggestions

#### Missing Features ‚ùå
- **Type Mismatch Fixes**: Not implemented (returns None)
- **Robust Symbol Resolution**: Unknown symbol handling inconsistent
- **Complete Test Coverage**: Several tests lack definitive assertions

### Required Fixes Before Acceptance üîß

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Fix failing test**: Resolve `test_no_actions_for_unknown_symbols` behavior
2. **Fix test assertions**: Replace multiple-possibility assertions with exact expectations
3. **Implement missing features**: Type mismatch actions, complete type signature logic

#### Test Quality Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Line 262**: Replace `assert!(actions.is_empty() || actions.len() < 2);` with exact count
2. **Lines 177-192**: Add definitive assertions instead of conditional printing
3. **Line 306**: Fix implementation or test expectation for unknown symbols

### Recommended Actions üìã
1. **Investigate unknown symbol handling**: Determine why actions are returned for undefined symbols
2. **Complete type mismatch implementation**: Implement actual type conversion suggestions
3. **Strengthen test assertions**: Ensure all tests validate single expected outcomes
4. **Add missing test coverage**: Ensure all acceptance criteria have corresponding tests

## üîç QA Results - RE-EVALUATION (January 2025)

**Status: STORY READY FOR ACCEPTANCE ‚úÖ**

### Developer Successfully Addressed All Critical Issues ‚úÖ

#### ‚úÖ Test Failure Resolution
- **Fixed**: `test_no_actions_for_unknown_symbols` now passes
- **Root Cause**: Cursor-based actions were being generated even with diagnostics present
- **Solution**: Modified logic to only generate cursor-based actions when `context.diagnostics.is_empty()`
- **Impact**: Improved UX by avoiding overwhelming users with unrelated suggestions during compile errors

#### ‚úÖ Type Mismatch Implementation Complete
- **Added**: Full `extract_type_mismatch_fix()` implementation with pattern matching
- **Added**: `suggest_type_conversion()` with comprehensive type conversions:
  - String ‚Üî Int conversions (`String.toInt`, `String.fromInt`)
  - Float ‚Üî Int conversions (`toFloat`, `round`) 
  - Maybe wrapping (`Just`)
  - Array ‚Üî List conversions (`Array.fromList`, `Array.toList`)
- **Result**: Type mismatch code actions now functional and tested

#### ‚úÖ Test Quality Violations Fixed
1. **`test_add_type_signature_code_action`**: Added definitive assertions replacing conditional printing
2. **`test_code_action_filtering_by_kind`**: Assertion now correctly validates no refactor actions with diagnostics
