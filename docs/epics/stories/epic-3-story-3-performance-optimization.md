## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Symbol Index Optimizations
- Implement database query optimization with proper indexing
- Add batch operations for bulk symbol updates
- Optimize tree-sitter query execution for large files
- Implement connection pooling for SQLite database access

### Caching Strategies
- LRU cache for parsed trees and symbol data
- Reference result caching with invalidation on file changes
- Document symbol cache for frequently accessed files
- Compilation result caching to avoid redundant compiler invocations

### Memory Management
- Implement proper cleanup of unused parse trees using Rust's Drop trait
- Optimize string interning for repeated symbol names using Arc<str>
- Use efficient data structures for large symbol collections (Vec, HashMap)
- Monitor and limit memory growth through explicit resource management

### Async Processing Improvements
- Optimize async/await patterns for better concurrency
- Implement background indexing for workspace initialization
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive symbol extraction
- Implement proper cancellation for long-running operations
