# Epic 1 Story 3: Document Lifecycle Management

## 📋 User Story
**As a** Gren developer  
**I want** my file changes tracked accurately by the LSP server  
**So that** language features work with my current document state

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document Manager implemented using lsp-textdocument crate
- [ ] didOpen, didChange, didClose notifications handled correctly
- [ ] UTF-16 position encoding working properly
- [ ] Incremental document updates applied correctly
- [ ] Parse tree updates triggered on document changes
- [ ] LRU cache implemented for closed documents (100 items)

## 🧪 Integration Test Requirements

### Test: Document Synchronization
- [ ] Test didOpen notification creates document state
- [ ] Test didChange applies incremental updates correctly
- [ ] Test didClose removes document from active state
- [ ] Test document versioning prevents race conditions

### Test: UTF-16 Position Encoding
- [ ] Test position calculations with multi-byte Unicode characters
- [ ] Test position mapping between LSP and internal representations
- [ ] Test edge cases with emoji and complex Unicode

### Test: Parse Tree Integration
- [ ] Test parse tree updates on document changes
- [ ] Test incremental parsing when possible
- [ ] Test full re-parsing when necessary
- [ ] Test parse tree cache invalidation

### Test: Memory Management
- [ ] Test LRU cache evicts old documents correctly
- [ ] Test memory usage bounded under continuous editing
- [ ] Test no memory leaks during document lifecycle

### Test: Error Handling
- [ ] Test handling of malformed document updates
- [ ] Test recovery from parse errors
- [ ] Test graceful handling of invalid positions

## ✅ Definition of Done
- Documents sync properly with no data loss
- Position calculations accurate for multi-byte characters
- Parse trees updated incrementally on changes
- Memory usage bounded by LRU cache
- All document lifecycle events handled correctly
- Integration tests pass with 100% reliability
