# Epic 6 Story 2: Server-Side Feature Gap Resolution

## üìã User Story
**As a** Gren LSP developer  
**I want** to resolve the specific server-side implementation gaps identified in Epic 6 Story 1 integration testing  
**So that** all LSP features work correctly through the VS Code extension with proper server responses

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix diagnostics publishing - compiler errors must appear in VS Code Problems panel
- [ ] Fix symbol indexing responses - server must return indexed symbols to extension requests
- [ ] Fix hover information responses - server must return type information and documentation
- [ ] Fix go-to-definition responses - server must return accurate definition locations
- [ ] Fix document symbols responses - server must return hierarchical symbol structures
- [ ] Validate Epic 3-4 advanced features work correctly through integration
- [ ] Ensure all fixes maintain performance requirements identified in Story 1
- [ ] Comprehensive re-testing validates all gaps resolved without regressions

## üß™ Integration Test Requirements

### Test: Diagnostics Publishing Fix
- [ ] Create Gren file with compiler errors (syntax, type, import errors)
- [ ] Verify errors appear in VS Code Problems panel with correct locations
- [ ] Test diagnostic clear when errors are fixed
- [ ] Validate diagnostic severity levels (error, warning, info)
- [ ] Test real-time diagnostic updates as code is edited

### Test: Symbol Indexing Response Fix
- [ ] Open workspace with multiple Gren files containing various symbols
- [ ] Verify symbol index populates correctly on workspace startup
- [ ] Test symbol index updates when files are modified
- [ ] Validate cross-file symbol resolution works correctly
- [ ] Test symbol index performance with large codebases

### Test: Hover Information Response Fix
- [ ] Hover over function names and verify type signatures appear
- [ ] Test hover on type definitions shows complete type information
- [ ] Verify hover on imported symbols shows correct module source
- [ ] Test hover on variables shows inferred or annotated types
- [ ] Validate hover response times meet performance requirements

### Test: Go-to-Definition Response Fix
- [ ] Use F12/Ctrl+Click on function calls to navigate to definitions
- [ ] Test go-to-definition across file boundaries
- [ ] Verify navigation to imported symbol definitions

### Test: Error Handling and User Feedback Gaps
- [ ] Test error message display for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify proper user feedback for long-running operations
- [ ] Check graceful degradation when server features are unavailable
- [ ] Test recovery mechanisms for various failure modes
- [ ] Validate clear communication of server status to users

### Test: Performance and Resource Gaps
- [ ] Identify any performance degradation introduced by extension layer
- [ ] Test resource usage (memory, CPU) of extension vs. direct server
- [ ] Verify efficient communication between extension and server
- [ ] Check for memory leaks or resource accumulation over time
- [ ] Test behavior under high load or large project scenarios

### Test: Cross-Platform Compatibility Gaps
- [ ] Test feature parity across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Verify file path handling works correctly on all platforms
- [ ] Check that compiler integration works across different environments
- [ ] Test extension behavior with different VS Code versions
- [ ] Validate unicode and international character handling

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Server Response Gap Analysis (Based on Story 1 Results)
- **Diagnostics Publishing**: Server has compiler integration but not publishing via LSP protocol
- **Symbol Responses**: Server has robust symbol indexing but returning empty responses to LSP requests
- **Hover Responses**: Server has hover engine but not returning formatted hover content
- **Definition Responses**: Server has go-to-definition logic but not returning location information
- **Document Symbol Responses**: Server has symbol extraction but not returning hierarchical structures

### LSP Message Handler Fixes
- Fix `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` message publishing from compiler integration
- Fix `textDocument/completion` response generation (working correctly per Story 1)
- Fix `textDocument/hover` response formatting and content generation
- Fix `textDocument/definition` location response generation
- Fix `textDocument/documentSymbol` hierarchical structure response generation

### Server Infrastructure Debugging
- Investigate symbol index query responses and ensure proper data flow
- Validate LSP message response formatting matches protocol specification
- Ensure asynchronous response handling doesn't drop messages
- Debug server logging to identify where responses are being lost

### Integration Validation Framework
- Re-run Epic 6 Story 1 integration tests after each fix
- Measure response times to ensure performance requirements maintained
- Validate that fixes don't introduce regressions in working features
- Test edge cases and error conditions for each fixed feature

## ‚ö° Performance Requirements
- Gap fixes should not introduce performance regressions
- Extension overhead should remain minimal after all fixes
- Server communication efficiency should be maintained or improved
- Large project handling should not be degraded by additional integrations

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- All critical server-side gaps identified in Story 1 resolved and tested:
  - ‚úÖ Diagnostics appear in VS Code Problems panel
  - ‚úÖ Hover information displays type signatures and documentation
  - ‚úÖ Go-to-definition navigates to correct locations
  - ‚úÖ Document symbols show in VS Code Outline panel
  - ‚úÖ Symbol indexing responses populated correctly
- Epic 3-4 advanced features validated working through extension integration
- Performance requirements from Story 1 maintained (13ms startup, sub-100ms responses)
- Comprehensive re-testing using Story 1 test suite shows significant improvement in success rate
- No regressions introduced in working features (Code Completion, LSP Lifecycle, Document Management)

```

## üí° Common Gap Categories

### Missing Capability Advertisement
```javascript
// Extension should advertise all server capabilities
const clientCapabilities = {
    textDocument: {
        completion: { /* ... */ },
        hover: { /* ... */ },
        signatureHelp: { /* ... */ },  // Often missing
        references: { /* ... */ },
        documentSymbol: { /* ... */ },
        codeAction: { /* ... */ },
        rename: { /* ... */ },
        // Check all Epic 1-5 capabilities are included
    }
};
```

### Missing Command Registration
```javascript
// Extension should register commands for all server operations
context.subscriptions.push(
    commands.registerCommand('gren.goToDefinition', ...),
    commands.registerCommand('gren.findReferences', ...),
    commands.registerCommand('gren.rename', ...),
    // Ensure all Epic 1-5 commands are registered
);
```

### Missing Context Menu Integration
```json
// package.json should include context menu items
"menus": {
    "editor/context": [
        {
            "when": "resourceLangId == gren",
            "command": "gren.findReferences",
            "group": "navigation"
        }
        // Ensure all applicable commands have menu items
    ]
}
```

### Missing Configuration Exposure
```json
// All server settings should be available in extension configuration
"configuration": {
    "properties": {
        "grenLsp.serverPath": { /* ... */ },
        "grenLsp.trace.server": { /* ... */ },
        // Ensure all Epic 1-5 server options are exposed
    }
}
```

This story ensures that the comprehensive LSP server functionality developed in Epic 1-5 is fully accessible and properly integrated through the VS Code extension, eliminating any barriers between implemented capabilities and user access.
