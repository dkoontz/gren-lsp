## üí° Navigation Examples

### Progressive Selection Expansion
```gren
-- Starting with cursor on "name" in: user.name
-- Selection 1: |name|
-- Selection 2: |user.name|
-- Selection 3: |String.toUpper user.name|
-- Selection 4: |email = String.toUpper user.name|
-- Selection 5: |{ user | email = String.toUpper user.name }|

updateUser : User -> User
updateUser user =
    { user | email = String.toUpper user.name }
```

### Function Definition Folding

-- Unfolded
createUser : String -> Int -> User
createUser name age =

        validAge =
            max 0 age
    in
    { name = trimmedName, age = validAge }

-- Folded (shows signature, hides implementation)
createUser : String -> Int -> User ‚è∑
```

### Type Definition Folding

    = Anonymous
    | Registered String Int
    | Premium String Int (Array String)

### Let Expression Folding
```gren

        validatedAge =
            if user.age < 0 then
                0
            else
                user.age
        
        updatedUser =

            | name = normalizedName
            , age = validatedAge
            }

        UserDeleted userId ->
            ( { model

              }

### Import Section Folding
```gren
-- Unfolded
import Array
import String
