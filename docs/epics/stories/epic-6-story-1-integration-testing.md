# Epic 6 Story 1: LSP Server-Extension Integration Testing

## üìã User Story
**As a** Gren LSP developer  
**I want** comprehensive testing of all Epic 1-5 LSP features through the VS Code extension  
**So that** I can validate complete integration and identify any gaps between server capabilities and extension functionality

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test all Epic 1 features: LSP lifecycle, document management, tree-sitter integration, diagnostics
- [ ] Test all Epic 2 features: symbol indexing, code completion, hover information, go-to-definition
- [ ] Test all Epic 3 features: find references, document symbols, performance optimization
- [ ] Test all Epic 4 features: code actions, workspace symbols, safe symbol rename 
- [ ] Test all Epic 5 features: advanced refactoring (module rename if implemented)
- [ ] Validate LSP protocol compliance for all implemented features
- [ ] Document integration test results with detailed pass/fail analysis
- [ ] Identify any features that work in server but fail through extension

## üß™ Integration Test Requirements

### Test: Epic 1 - Foundation & Testing
- [ ] **LSP Lifecycle**: Extension starts/stops server correctly, handles initialization
- [ ] **Document Management**: Open/close/edit Gren files triggers proper server notifications
- [ ] **Tree-sitter Integration**: Syntax highlighting and parsing work correctly
- [ ] **Diagnostics**: Compiler errors appear in VS Code Problems panel with correct locations
- [ ] **Server Stability**: No crashes during normal operation, proper error recovery

### Test: Epic 2 - Core Language Intelligence  
- [ ] **Symbol Indexing**: Symbols indexed correctly when opening workspace
- [ ] **Code Completion**: IntelliSense triggers on "." and provides relevant suggestions
- [ ] **Hover Information**: Hover shows type information and documentation
- [ ] **Go-to-Definition**: F12/Ctrl+Click navigates to correct symbol definitions
- [ ] **Cross-Module Navigation**: Go-to-definition works across file boundaries

### Test: Epic 3 - Advanced Navigation & References
- [ ] **Find References**: Right-click "Find All References" shows all symbol usages
- [ ] **Document Symbols**: Outline panel shows hierarchical symbol structure
- [ ] **Symbol Navigation**: Click-to-navigate from outline works correctly
- [ ] **Performance**: Reference finding completes within response time requirements
- [ ] **Large Project Support**: Features work correctly in projects with 50+ files

### Test: Epic 4 - Polish and Enhancement
- [ ] **Code Actions**: Light bulb suggestions appear for fixable errors
- [ ] **Missing Import Actions**: Quick fixes suggest adding missing imports
- [ ] **Workspace Symbols**: Ctrl+T search finds symbols across project
- [ ] **Symbol Rename**: F2 rename works across files with preview
- [ ] **Compilation Validation**: Rename operations maintain project compilation

### Test: Epic 5 - Advanced Refactoring (if implemented)
- [ ] **Module Rename**: File rename operations update imports correctly
- [ ] **Workspace Operations**: Complex refactoring maintains project integrity
- [ ] **File System Integration**: Extension handles file operations properly

### Test: VS Code Extension Specific Features
- [ ] **Compiler Management**: Automatic Gren compiler download works
- [ ] **Configuration**: Extension settings apply correctly to server
- [ ] **Debug Features**: Parse tree export functions correctly
- [ ] **Output Channels**: Server logs appear in proper VS Code output channels
- [ ] **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for common failure scenarios

### Test: LSP Protocol Compliance
- [ ] **Message Format**: All LSP messages follow JSON-RPC specification
- [ ] **Capability Negotiation**: Server advertises correct capabilities to client
- [ ] **Request/Response**: All request types receive proper responses
- [ ] **Notifications**: Server sends appropriate notifications for document changes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Protocol errors handled gracefully without connection loss

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Test Environment Setup
- Use existing VS Code extension test infrastructure
- Create comprehensive test workspace with various Gren project structures
- Set up automated test execution for repeatable validation
- Configure test data with known expected outcomes

### Integration Test Categories
- **Unit Integration Tests**: Individual LSP features through extension
- **Workflow Integration Tests**: Complete development scenarios
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Validation on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Performance Integration Tests**: Response times and resource usage

### Test Documentation Framework
- Structured test result documentation with pass/fail status
- Detailed failure analysis with error messages and reproduction steps
- Integration gap identification with specific missing functionality
- Performance benchmark results with comparison to requirements

### Validation Methodology
- Compare extension behavior against LSP server direct testing
- Validate feature parity between server capabilities and extension exposure
- Test edge cases and error conditions through extension interface
- Measure performance characteristics under realistic usage

## ‚ö° Performance Requirements
- All Epic 1-5 performance requirements must be met through extension
- Extension overhead should be minimal (< 50MB memory, < 100ms startup delay)
- LSP communication should not introduce significant latency
- Large project handling should maintain responsiveness

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
