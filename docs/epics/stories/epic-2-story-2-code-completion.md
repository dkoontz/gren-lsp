# Epic 2 Story 2: Code Completion

## 📋 User Story
**As a** Gren developer  
**I want** intelligent code completion suggestions  
**So that** I can write code faster with fewer errors

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Module Member Completion**: Functions and types available from imported modules
- [ ] **Local Variable Completion**: Variables in current scope (let bindings, function parameters)
- [ ] **Keyword Completion**: Gren language keywords (when, let, if, etc.)
- [ ] **Trigger Characters**: Automatic completion on "." character
- [ ] **Rich Completion Items**: Include type signatures, documentation, and import source
- [ ] **Scope-Aware**: Only suggest symbols available in current context

## 🧪 Integration Test Requirements

### Test: Module Member Completion
- [ ] Import module and test completion after "ModuleName."
- [ ] Verify only exported symbols suggested
- [ ] Test completion includes type signatures
- [ ] Test completion with qualified imports

### Test: Local Scope Completion
- [ ] Test completion in function bodies, let expressions
- [ ] Verify local variables take precedence over imports
- [ ] Test nested scope handling
- [ ] Test function parameter completion

### Test: Keyword Completion
- [ ] Test keyword suggestions in appropriate contexts
- [ ] Verify keywords not suggested in inappropriate contexts
- [ ] Test context-sensitive keyword filtering
- [ ] Test keyword completion in various language constructs

### Test: Performance Requirements
- [ ] All completion requests respond within 100ms
- [ ] Test with large symbol sets (1000+ symbols)
- [ ] Memory usage remains bounded during completion
- [ ] Test completion performance with complex projects

### Test: Completion Item Quality
- [ ] Test completion items include accurate type information
- [ ] Test documentation extraction and display
- [ ] Test import source attribution
- [ ] Test completion item sorting and ranking

## ✅ Definition of Done
- Completion works in all major Gren code contexts
- Response time consistently < 100ms for 95% of requests
- Completion items include accurate type information
- No irrelevant suggestions (scope-aware filtering)
- All completion contexts properly handled
