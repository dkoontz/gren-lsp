# Epic 2 Story 4: Go-to-Definition

## 📋 User Story
**As a** Gren developer  
**I want** to navigate directly to symbol definitions  
**So that** I can understand and modify code efficiently

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Local Definitions**: Navigate to definitions within same file
- [x] **Cross-Module Definitions**: Navigate to definitions in other project files
- [x] **Package Definitions**: Navigate to definitions in installed packages (if accessible)
- [x] **Precise Results**: Never return multiple results for unambiguous Gren symbols
- [x] **Deterministic**: Leverage Gren's lack of polymorphic overloading for exact matches

## 🧪 Integration Test Requirements

### Test: Local Definition Navigation
- [x] Test navigation to function definitions in same file
- [x] Test navigation to type definitions
- [x] Test navigation to let-bound variables
- [x] Test navigation to function parameters

### Test: Cross-Module Navigation
- [x] Test navigation to imported symbols
- [x] Test navigation across multiple files
- [x] Test navigation to transitive imports
- [x] Test navigation with qualified imports

### Test: Precision Requirements
- [x] Verify exactly one result for each unambiguous symbol
- [x] Test that ambiguous symbols return appropriate error
- [x] Test edge cases with shadowed variables
- [x] Test deterministic behavior with Gren's import semantics

### Test: Performance Requirements
- [x] All definition requests respond within 200ms
- [x] Test performance with large projects
- [x] Test definition lookup caching effectiveness
- [x] Test memory usage during intensive navigation

### Test: Edge Cases
- [x] Test navigation from different symbol contexts
- [x] Test navigation with complex module hierarchies
- [x] Test navigation with re-exported symbols
- [x] Test error handling for undefined symbols

## ✅ Definition of Done
- Local and cross-module navigation works with 100% accuracy
- Never returns multiple results for deterministic Gren symbols
- Response time consistently < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Handles all Gren symbol types (functions, types, variables)
- Precision requirement: zero false positives
