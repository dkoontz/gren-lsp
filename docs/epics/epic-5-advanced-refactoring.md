# Epic 5: Advanced Refactoring Operations - Brownfield Enhancement

## üéØ Epic Goal
Complete the professional refactoring suite by adding Module Rename and advanced workspace operations to provide comprehensive project restructuring capabilities for large Gren codebases.

## üìù Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: Epic 1-4 completed (LSP foundation, core language intelligence, advanced navigation, polish/enhancement)
- Technology stack: Rust, async-lsp, tree-sitter, SQLite symbol indexing, JSON-RPC communication, workspace management
- Integration points: File system operations, LSP workspace protocol, editor file watchers, symbol index database, workspace synchronization

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added**: Module Rename (workspace/willRenameFiles, workspace/didRenameFiles), advanced workspace restructuring operations, and file system-aware refactoring capabilities
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing rename infrastructure with file system operations, workspace synchronization, and editor integration protocols
- **Success criteria**: Safe module renames with 100% accuracy, proper file system transaction semantics, seamless editor integration

**Value Delivered**: Developers gain advanced project restructuring capabilities essential for maintaining large Gren codebases, enabling confident architectural refactoring and module organization changes.

## üìã Stories

### Story 1: Module Rename with File System Operations
**Priority**: High - Advanced refactoring capability for project restructuring  
**Description**: Implement module rename functionality with file system operations, workspace synchronization, and LSP workspace protocol integration to safely rename modules across the entire project structure.

### Story 2: Advanced Workspace Operations  
**Priority**: Medium - Enhanced workspace management for complex refactoring  
**Description**: Implement workspace-wide refactoring operations including directory restructuring, batch file operations, and workspace state synchronization for complex architectural changes.

### Story 3: Editor Integration and Workspace Sync
**Priority**: Medium - Seamless editor experience for file operations  
**Description**: Implement comprehensive editor integration for file system operations with proper workspace synchronization, file watcher integration, and transaction rollback capabilities.

## üîß Compatibility Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Existing APIs remain unchanged**: LSP workspace protocol extensions only, existing textDocument/rename functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **File system operations are transactional**: Atomic operations with proper rollback capability for failed renames
- ‚úÖ **Editor integration follows LSP standards**: Proper workspace/willRenameFiles and workspace/didRenameFiles protocol implementation
- ‚úÖ **Performance impact is minimal**: Leverages existing symbol indexing and file monitoring infrastructure

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk**: File system operations causing workspace corruption or inconsistent state across editors  
**Mitigation**: Transactional file operations, comprehensive validation before applying changes, workspace state backup/restore capability  
**Rollback Plan**: File system operations can be reverted through workspace restore, existing symbol rename functionality remains unaffected, editor workspace sync can recover from inconsistent states

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- ‚úÖ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met (100% accuracy for module renames, safe file operations, seamless editor integration)
- ‚úÖ Existing functionality preserved and verified through comprehensive regression testing  
- ‚úÖ Integration with file system operations, workspace management, and editor protocols working correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated for new workspace capabilities and file operation safety
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing Epic 1-4 features
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met for large workspace operations (100+ files)

## üîó Epic Dependencies & Integration

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Epic 1-4 completed (LSP foundation, core features, navigation, polish/enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Epic 4 Story 3 completed (Safe Symbol Rename providing text-based rename infrastructure)
- ‚úÖ File system monitoring and workspace management operational
- ‚úÖ Symbol indexing with cross-file reference resolution established

### Architecture Alignment
- **File System Operations**: Transactional file operations with atomic commit/rollback semantics

## ‚úÖ Epic Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Module Rename operations maintain 100% compilation success with proper import statement updates
- File system operations are atomic with reliable rollback capability
- Workspace synchronization maintains consistency across multiple editors
- All file operations integrate seamlessly with existing LSP infrastructure

### Performance Success
- Module Rename: < 5 seconds for typical module rename operations in 100+ file projects
- File Operations: < 1 second for 95% of single file operations
- Workspace Sync: < 500ms for workspace state synchronization across editors
- Memory usage remains bounded during intensive file operations

### Quality Success
- 100% test coverage for new file operation and workspace synchronization handlers
- Zero data loss during file operations with comprehensive validation
- File operations maintain workspace integrity during concurrent editor usage
- Graceful handling of file system conflicts and permission issues

### Integration Success

- Compatible with multiple LSP clients and their workspace protocols
- File operations work correctly across different operating systems
- Proper integration with existing version control systems

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

### File System Operation Framework
- **Transactional Operations**: Atomic file operations with staging and commit phases
- **Validation Pipeline**: Pre-operation validation to prevent corruption
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Comprehensive rollback capability for failed operations
- **Permission Handling**: Proper handling of file system permissions and conflicts

### Workspace Protocol Implementation
- **LSP Protocol Compliance**: Full implementation of workspace file operation protocol
- **Multi-Editor Coordination**: Handle concurrent operations across multiple LSP clients
- **State Synchronization**: Maintain consistent workspace state during file operations
- **Change Notification**: Proper notification of workspace changes to all connected clients

### Integration Complexity
- **Symbol Index Updates**: Update symbol database during file operations
- **Import Statement Rewriting**: Parse and update import statements across workspace
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Handle file system differences across operating systems
- **Editor-Specific Behavior**: Account for variations in LSP client implementations
