# Gren LSP Epic Overview

## Project Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a high-level overview of the epic structure for implementing the Gren Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. The implementation is organized into 5 major epics that build upon each other to deliver a complete LSP solution.

## Epic Summary

### Epic 1: Project Foundation & Setup ‚ö° Critical Path
**Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure for LSP development
- Initialize Rust project structure
- Configure core dependencies (tower-lsp, tokio, serde)
- Set up development environment
- Implement basic LSP server scaffold
- Configure SQLite for symbol storage
- Create initial documentation
- Set up CI pipeline

**Duration Estimate:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** None (starting point)

### Epic 2: Core LSP Implementation üéØ Critical Path
**Goal:** Implement essential LSP features for basic Gren development
- Integrate tree-sitter-gren parser
- Implement document synchronization
- Create syntax error diagnostics
- Build symbol extraction system
- Enable basic code completion
- Implement go-to-definition
- Add hover information
- Create workspace symbol index

**Duration Estimate:** 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 complete

### Epic 3: Advanced Features & Integration üöÄ
**Goal:** Add advanced features and compiler integration
- Create Gren compiler integration layer
- Implement type-based diagnostics
- Enable rename refactoring
- Add find all references
- Implement import management
- Integrate code formatting
- Create code actions and quick fixes
- Add document symbols

**Duration Estimate:** 4-5 weeks
**Dependencies:** Epics 1 & 2 complete

### Epic 4: Testing & Quality Assurance üõ°Ô∏è
**Goal:** Ensure reliability and performance
- Set up unit testing framework
- Create LSP protocol integration tests
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Add end-to-end VS Code testing
- Implement fuzzing and property testing
- Perform load testing for large projects
- Test error recovery scenarios
- Establish code quality standards

**Duration Estimate:** 2-3 weeks (parallel with Epic 3)
**Dependencies:** Epics 1-3 provide functionality to test

### Epic 5: Documentation & Release üì¶
**Goal:** Package and distribute the LSP to users
- Write comprehensive user documentation
- Create VS Code extension package
- Generate API documentation
- Set up release automation
- Create distribution packages
- Write editor integration guides
- Provide migration guides
- Establish community resources

**Duration Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** All previous epics complete

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Complete Epic 1 to establish project structure
- Ensure development environment is reproducible
- Get basic LSP server responding to clients

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
- Implement Epic 2 for essential functionality
- Begin Epic 4 testing in parallel
- Deliver usable LSP with basic features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-11)
- Complete Epic 3 for full feature set
- Continue comprehensive testing
- Achieve feature parity with PRD requirements

### Phase 4: Polish & Release (Weeks 12-14)
- Finalize Epic 4 testing and quality
- Complete Epic 5 documentation and packaging
- Release v1.0 to community

## Critical Path

The critical path for MVP delivery:
1. Epic 1 ‚Üí Epic 2 ‚Üí Basic Epic 5 (VS Code extension)

This provides a minimal viable LSP with:
- Syntax highlighting
- Error diagnostics
- Basic completion
- Go-to definition

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **tree-sitter-gren completeness:** May need contributions to grammar
- **Compiler integration complexity:** Start with CLI, move to FFI later
- **Performance at scale:** Aggressive caching and incremental processing

### Resource Risks
- **Limited Gren ecosystem knowledge:** Study compiler and existing tools
- **Testing complexity:** Invest in test infrastructure early
- **Platform-specific issues:** Focus on Linux/macOS first, Windows later

## Success Metrics

- **Performance:** < 100ms response time for completion requests
- **Reliability:** > 99% uptime during development sessions
- **Coverage:** Support for all PRD-specified features
- **Quality:** > 80% test coverage, < 5 bugs per release
- **Adoption:** 100+ downloads in first month

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve epic structure
2. Create individual story tickets in issue tracker
3. Set up project repository with Epic 1, Story 1.1
4. Begin implementation following the roadmap

This epic structure provides a clear path from zero to a fully-featured Gren LSP implementation, with careful attention to dependencies, testing, and user experience.
