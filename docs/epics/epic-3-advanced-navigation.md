# Epic 3: Advanced Navigation & References - Brownfield Enhancement

## üéØ Epic Goal
Complete the essential LSP feature set by adding Find References and Document Symbols functionality to provide comprehensive code navigation capabilities for Gren developers.

## üìù Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: Epic 1 (LSP foundation, document management, diagnostics) and Epic 2 (completion, hover, go-to-definition) completed
- Technology stack: Rust, async-lsp, tree-sitter, SQLite symbol indexing, JSON-RPC communication
- Integration points: Symbol index database, LSP message handlers, tree-sitter query system, editor LSP clients

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added**: Find References (textDocument/references) and Document Symbols (textDocument/documentSymbol) LSP features
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing symbol indexing infrastructure and LSP handler patterns established in Epic 1-2
- **Success criteria**: 100% accuracy for reference finding, hierarchical document symbol navigation, performance within LSP requirements

**Value Delivered**: Developers gain complete code navigation capabilities - finding all symbol usages across projects and navigating large files through hierarchical symbol outlines.

## üìã Stories

### [Story 1: Find All References Implementation](stories/epic-3-story-1-find-references.md)
**Priority**: Highest - Critical LSP feature missing from current implementation
**Description**: Implement textDocument/references to find all usages of symbols across the project with 100% accuracy leveraging Gren's deterministic semantics.

### [Story 2: Document Symbol Hierarchy](stories/epic-3-story-2-document-symbols.md)
**Priority**: High - Essential for navigation in larger files  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/documentSymbol to provide hierarchical symbol outline showing modules, functions, types, and their relationships for quick within-file navigation.

### [Story 3: Performance Optimization & Large Project Support](stories/epic-3-story-3-performance-optimization.md)
**Priority**: Medium - Addresses scalability for professional use
**Description**: Optimize symbol indexing and query performance to handle projects with 100+ files while maintaining sub-200ms response times for references and symbols.

## üîß Compatibility Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Existing APIs remain unchanged**: LSP protocol extensions only, no changes to existing message handlers
- ‚úÖ **Database schema changes are backward compatible**: Extensions to existing SQLite symbol index schema
- ‚úÖ **UI changes follow existing patterns**: Consistent with existing LSP response formats
- ‚úÖ **Performance impact is minimal**: Leverages existing symbol indexing infrastructure

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk**: Performance degradation when indexing references in large codebases
**Mitigation**: Incremental indexing updates, optimized tree-sitter queries, LRU caching for reference data
**Rollback Plan**: Features can be disabled via LSP capability negotiation, existing functionality remains unaffected

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- ‚úÖ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met (100% accuracy, performance targets)
- ‚úÖ Existing functionality verified through regression testing
- ‚úÖ Integration with symbol indexing and LSP handlers working correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated for new LSP capabilities
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing Epic 1-2 features

---

## üîó Epic Dependencies & Integration

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Epic 1 completed (LSP foundation, document management, tree-sitter baseline)
- ‚úÖ Epic 2 completed (symbol indexing, completion, hover, go-to-definition)
- ‚úÖ SQLite symbol index operational
- ‚úÖ Tree-sitter queries for symbol extraction established

### Architecture Alignment
- **Symbol Index Extensions**: Reference tracking, hierarchical symbol relationships
- **Performance Optimizations**: Query optimization, caching strategies for reference data
- **LSP Handler Extensions**: textDocument/references, textDocument/documentSymbol handlers

## ‚úÖ Epic Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Find References returns 100% accurate results with zero false positives
- Document Symbols provides complete hierarchical navigation for all Gren constructs
- Reference finding works correctly across modules and complex Gren patterns
- Symbol hierarchy accurately represents Gren module structure

### Performance Success
- Find References: < 200ms response time for 95% of requests
- Document Symbols: < 100ms response time for 95% of requests
- Memory usage remains bounded during intensive reference operations
- Handles projects with 100+ files effectively

### Quality Success
- 100% test coverage for new reference and symbol handlers
- Zero false positives in reference results (leveraging Gren's deterministic semantics)
- Symbol index maintains consistency during file modifications
- Graceful degradation when reference data is unavailable
