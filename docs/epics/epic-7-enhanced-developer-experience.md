# Epic 7: Enhanced Developer Experience - Brownfield Enhancement

## üéØ Epic Goal
Complete the professional IDE experience by adding essential developer productivity features including code formatting, signature help, and advanced navigation aids that developers expect from modern language servers.

## üìù Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: Epic 1-6 completed (LSP foundation, core features, navigation, polish, advanced refactoring, VS Code extension)
- Technology stack: Comprehensive Rust LSP server with VS Code extension, Gren compiler integration, tree-sitter parsing
- Integration points: LSP protocol handlers, Gren compiler for formatting, tree-sitter queries for navigation, editor UI integration

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added**: Code formatting (textDocument/formatting), signature help (textDocument/signatureHelp), and advanced navigation features (selectionRange, foldingRange)
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing LSP handler infrastructure, integrates with Gren compiler for formatting, enhances tree-sitter queries for navigation
- **Success criteria**: Professional code formatting quality, accurate signature help for functions, efficient navigation aids for large files

**Value Delivered**: Developers gain the final professional IDE features that complete the modern development experience, matching capabilities found in commercial IDEs and other mature language servers.

## üìã Stories

### Story 1: Code Formatting Integration
**Priority**: Highest - Table stakes for professional development  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/formatting and textDocument/rangeFormatting with Gren compiler integration to provide consistent, high-quality code formatting that matches community standards.

### Story 2: Signature Help for Functions
**Priority**: High - Critical for function discoverability and parameter guidance  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/signatureHelp to provide real-time function signature information with parameter hints, documentation, and active parameter highlighting.

### Story 3: Advanced Navigation Aids
**Priority**: Medium - Enhanced navigation for large files and complex code structures  
**Description**: Implement textDocument/selectionRange and textDocument/foldingRange to provide intelligent text selection and code folding capabilities for improved code navigation.

### Story 4: Proactive Import Completion
**Priority**: High - Essential for seamless development workflow  
**Description**: Extend code completion to automatically suggest and add import statements for unimported symbols, providing both exposed and qualified import variants for functions, types, and other symbols across the workspace.

## üîß Compatibility Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Existing LSP infrastructure preserved**: New handlers extend existing architecture without changes
- ‚úÖ **Gren compiler integration**: Leverages existing compiler integration for formatting consistency
- ‚úÖ **Editor compatibility**: Features work across all LSP clients (VS Code, Neovim, Emacs)
- ‚úÖ **Performance maintained**: New features meet existing response time requirements

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk**: Formatting operations introducing syntax errors or inconsistent code style  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation against Gren compiler, extensive testing with real codebases, rollback capability for formatting operations  
**Rollback Plan**: Features can be disabled via LSP capability negotiation, existing functionality remains unaffected

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- ‚úÖ Code formatting produces syntactically correct, well-formatted Gren code consistent with community standards
- ‚úÖ Signature help provides accurate function signatures with parameter information and documentation
- ‚úÖ Selection range and folding range enable efficient navigation in large files
- ‚úÖ All features integrate seamlessly with existing LSP infrastructure and VS Code extension
- ‚úÖ Performance requirements met for typical development scenarios
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing validates feature accuracy and editor compatibility

---

## üîó Epic Dependencies & Integration

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Epic 1-6 completed (Full LSP server with VS Code extension)
- ‚úÖ Gren compiler integration established for diagnostics and validation
- ‚úÖ Tree-sitter parsing infrastructure for syntax analysis
- ‚úÖ Symbol indexing for function signature resolution

### Architecture Alignment
- **LSP Handler Extensions**: New message handlers following established patterns
- **Compiler Integration**: Enhanced integration for formatting operations
- **Tree-sitter Enhancements**: Advanced queries for navigation and folding
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching and incremental processing for new features

---

## ‚úÖ Epic Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Code formatting produces consistent, readable Gren code that compiles successfully
- Signature help shows accurate function signatures with parameter names and types
- Selection range enables smart text selection following Gren syntax boundaries
- Folding range allows collapsing functions, types, and other logical code blocks

### Performance Success
- Formatting: < 500ms for files up to 1000 lines
- Signature help: < 100ms response time for function signature lookup
- Selection/folding range: < 200ms for range calculation in large files
- Memory usage remains bounded during intensive formatting operations

### Quality Success
- 100% test coverage for new formatting, signature help, and navigation handlers
- Formatting operations maintain 100% syntax correctness with compiler validation
- Signature help accuracy matches function definitions across all symbol types
- Navigation features work correctly with nested Gren language constructs

### User Experience Success
- Formatting integrates seamlessly with editor "Format Document" commands
- Signature help appears automatically during function calls with proper parameter highlighting
- Selection range enables efficient code selection and manipulation
- Folding range provides logical code organization for large files

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

### Code Formatting Strategy
- **Gren Compiler Integration**: Use official Gren formatter for consistency
- **Incremental Formatting**: Support both full document and range formatting
- **Validation Pipeline**: Ensure formatted code compiles successfully
- **Configuration Support**: Respect project-specific formatting preferences

### Signature Help Implementation
- **Symbol Resolution**: Leverage existing symbol index for function lookup
- **Documentation Integration**: Include function documentation in signature help
- **Parameter Tracking**: Active parameter highlighting during function calls
- **Overload Support**: Handle multiple function signatures where applicable

### Navigation Enhancement
